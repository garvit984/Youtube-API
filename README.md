# yt-api-task

# Project Goal

To make an API to fetch latest videos sorted in reverse chronological order of their publishing date-time from YouTube for a given tag/search query in a paginated response.

# âœ… Basic Requirements:

- âœ… Server should call the YouTube API continuously in background (async) with some interval (using 1 minute) for fetching the latest videos for a predefined search query and should store the data of videos (specifically these fields - Video title, description, publishing datetime, thumbnails URLs) in a database with proper indexes.
- âœ… A GET API which returns the stored video data in a paginated response sorted in descending order of published datetime.
  - endpoint: /api/video
  - sample query: http://localhost/api/video?p=2&s=3
- âœ… A basic search API to search the stored videos using their title and description.
  - endpoint: /api/video/search
  - sample query: http://localhost/api/video/search?s=music&p=2&s=3
- âœ… Dockerize the project.
  - run using docker-compose
- âœ… It should be scalable and optimised.

# Bonus Points:

- âœ… Add support for supplying multiple API keys so that if quota is exhausted on one, it automatically uses the next available key.
  - can cycle through multiple API keys when current key gets exhausted
- ðŸš§ Make a dashboard to view the stored videos with filters and sorting options (optional)
- âœ… Optimise search api, so that it's able to search videos containing partial match for the search query in either video title or description.
  - using industry standard elastic search with full text search and partial match capabilities

# Instructions
